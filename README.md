# PCA Visualization Tool

## Overview
This Python script demonstrates the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a synthetic dataset for dimensionality reduction. By reducing a 3-dimensional dataset to 2 dimensions, it facilitates easier visualization and analysis. This tool is intended for educational purposes, showcasing how PCA can be applied to data science and machine learning projects.

## Features
- **Synthetic Dataset Generation:** Automatically generates a 3-dimensional dataset using `sklearn.datasets.make_blobs`.
- **PCA Transformation:** Applies PCA to reduce the dataset from 3 dimensions to 2, enabling straightforward visualization.
- **Visualization:** Provides comparative plots of the original 3D dataset and the 2D transformed dataset, complete with class labels.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or later
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these requirements via pip:
```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib sklearn
```

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed on your machine.
2. Save the provided PCA script to a file, for example, `pca_visualization.py`.
3. Run the script using Python:
   ```sh
   python pca_visualization.py
   ```
4. Observe the output plots displaying the original data in 3D and the transformed data in 2D.
